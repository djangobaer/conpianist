# ConPianist

"ConPianist" or "Connected Pianist" is an app to control Yamaha digital pianos of CSP (Clavinova Smart Piano) series. This is an alternative to Yamaha's own app "Smart Pianist". As opposite to Smart Pianist, which works on iOS and soon Android, Connected Pianist is designed for desktop systems - macOS, Windows and Linux.

The project is at very early stage. Public releases will be offered as soon as the app becomes useful, which may take a while actually. If you have a compatible piano (CSP-150/CSP-170) and want to try the very alpha version of the app please get in touch via issue tracker.
